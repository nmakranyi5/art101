					<h2>Nikolas Makranyi</h2>
					<h3>Student</h3>
					<p>Hello! My name is <b>Nikolas Makranyi</b>, and I am a third year student double majoring in <b>Computer Science</b> and <b>Computer Science: Game Design</b> at <b>UCSC</b>. I am from the San Francisco Bay Area, and have lived here my whole life.</p>
					<p>I am interested in all things tech related. Being a student here at UCSC, I have been exposed to many different aspects of tech, ranging from using Assembly Language, to running Machine Learning algorithms on datasets. On the side, I also enjoy designing games, as I like coming up with ideas for new universes and settings. Games I have made include <i>Astrojumper</i>, an <i>Asteroids</i>-esque space shooter made on GDevelop, and <i>Stormheir: Retribution</i>, a visual novel game made with Twine.</p>
					<p>Other than tech related topics, I enjoy activities like working out at the gym, kayaking, and just going on walks. I also sometimes dabble in making music, which is pretty fun to do. Writing stories is also a hobby of mine, as this allows me to drift off to another world. I also enjoy playing video games, and the game I am currently playing is <i>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</i>.</p>
					<p>A fun fact about me is that I have a cat named Simba, who is 7 years old.</p>
