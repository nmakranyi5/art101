			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocode and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Come up with pseudocode for an every day task, simple computer game, and turning it into comments.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A difficult thing for me was coming up with a topic to turn into pseudocode. I was unsure on how to properly format the text in the code block, so that was the most difficult for me.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I thought this assignment was quite simple, as it is just breaking down an action/topic into steps. A lot of energy was put into breaking down the topics into steps.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Results</h2>

				<p>Above is our pseudocoding of a simple computer game, Rock-Paper-Scissors.</p>

					// Rock-Paper-Scissors
					// An implementation of the game

					// Constants

					// Functions

					// Print the board before each turn
					// Loop through each option
					// Ask the user to choose between three options: Rock, Paper, Scissors
					// Print user move
					// Print computer move
						// If user wins:
							// User won, print winning statement
