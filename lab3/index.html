			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Get acquainted with the file structures of the art101 directory, add content to the homepage, 
						and answer the questions on this document.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The most difficult thing for me was initially finding a partner to work with, as I wanted to switch up partners for each assignment. 
						The next problem for me was properly formatting the portrait, but some tutorials on W3Schools helped me with that.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I thought this assignment was pretty helpful in clearing up any confusion about the file structure, 
						as I remember having some problems with it in the previous lab.
					</p>
