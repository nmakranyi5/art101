			<h1>Hello World</h1>
			<h2>Introductions</h2>
			<p>Hello! My name is Nikolas. 
				I am a third year Computer Science student. 
				I am from the Bay Area, and enjoy doing things like kayaking, going to the gym, and going on walks outside.
				Because I do not have too much experience in HTML/CSS and none in JavaScript, I am excited to take this class, as I have been wanting to learn JS for a while now.
				A fun fact about me is that I have a cat named Simba, who is 7 years old.
			</p>
			<p>My partner's name is Karan. 
			He is a fourth year Business Management student. 
			</p>
			<h2>Cool Pet Photos</h2>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some trouble with getting the images centered, but a tutorial from W3Schools helped.</p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
